We created a simple dungeon crawler as a python project.

#### The rules are very simple:
Two players, first one to the top wins.
Choose game length (currently three options, first to lvl 3, first to lvl 6, first to lvl 10. The longer the game, the more you decisions will matter in the end. <br>
You enter the dungeon, you face a random monster at a random level. <br>
You make a choice wether to fight or try to run away. <br><br>
If you fight and lose, you get knocked down a level (to a minimum of 0). <br>
If you fight and win, you get to choose one of two options of loot: a sword (that will add to your rolls when fighting monsters) or a shield (that will add to your rolls when trying to run away from monsters). <br>
If you run and fail, you get knocked down a level (to a minimum of 0). <br>
If you run and succeed, you stay on your current level and can continue with a new random monster in your next turn. <br><br>
First one to the top will face the boss. <br>
Defeat the boss first = <b>WIN</b>
